# 🚀 Database Performance Monitoring & Analytics System

🚀 End-to-end data pipeline to monitor system performance, ensure data quality, and generate actionable insights.

**Real-world ETL + SQL analytics system to monitor database performance, detect SLA breaches, and optimize system health.**

📌 Built to simulate real-world production monitoring systems used in backend and API environments
📌 Focus: Data quality • Performance analytics • System reliability

---

## 🔹 Executive Summary

Modern applications generate massive logs that are noisy and inconsistent. Poor data quality leads to wrong decisions, while hidden performance issues impact reliability.

👉 This project demonstrates how to **Generate → Validate → Store → Analyze → Monitor** logs using a complete pipeline.

---

## 📌 Key Highlights

* End-to-end ETL pipeline (Python + SQL)
* Real-time log simulation with failures & latency
* Data validation with rejected data handling
* SLA, P95, P99 performance tracking
* 40+ SQL queries (basic → advanced → diagnostics)
* Power BI dashboard for system monitoring

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

* Raw logs are **noisy, inconsistent, unreliable**
* Poor data quality → **incorrect analytics & decisions**
* Performance issues remain hidden without **structured monitoring**

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

* Logs generated with realistic latency, retries, failures
* ETL pipeline validates & cleans data
* Invalid records stored separately for debugging
* SQL analytics computes KPIs & diagnostics
* Power BI dashboard visualizes system health
