# 🚀 Database Performance Monitoring System

📌 Built to simulate real-world production monitoring systems
📌 Focus: Data quality + performance analytics + system reliability

A real-time **ETL + SQL Analytics pipeline** that simulates system logs, enforces data quality, monitors pipeline health, and generates performance insights using MySQL and Power BI.

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern applications generate massive volumes of logs, but:

* Raw logs are often **noisy, inconsistent, and unreliable**
* Poor data quality leads to **incorrect analytics and decisions**
* Performance issues remain hidden without **structured monitoring**

👉 This project solves it by building an **end-to-end data pipeline**:

**Generate → Validate → Store → Analyze → Monitor**

---

# 💡 What Makes This Project Stand Out

* Simulates real-world system behavior (latency, retries, failures)
* Implements strong data validation to prevent bad data entry
* Separates **clean vs rejected data** for reliable analytics
* Tracks pipeline health using ETL metrics
* Computes advanced KPIs (SLA breach, latency, health score)
* End-to-end pipeline from raw data → dashboard insights

# 🧩 Key Design Decisions

* Separated rejected data to avoid corrupt analytics
* Used CSV as raw layer for traceability and debugging
* Designed modular SQL scripts for scalability
* Introduced ETL metrics to monitor pipeline health
* Structured queries into layers (basic → KPI → advanced)

---

# 🧱 Core Components

## 1. Log Simulator (Python)

* Generates realistic system logs continuously
* Simulates latency, errors, retries, and edge cases

## 2. ETL Pipeline

* Validates incoming data using rules
* Separates:

  * ✅ Valid records → `system_logs`
  * ❌ Invalid records → `rejected_logs`
* Tracks pipeline stats in `etl_metrics`

## 3. SQL Analytics Layer

* Modular SQL scripts:

  * Basic metrics
  * KPI calculations
  * Advanced performance analysis
* Optimized using views and structured queries

## 4. Dashboard Layer

* Power BI dashboard for:

  * System health monitoring
  * Latency trends
  * Error tracking
  * SLA compliance

# 🛠️ Setup & Execution

## 1. Setup Database

```sql
source sql/00_schema.sql;
```

---

## 2. Run Simulator

```bash
python scripts/log_simulator.py
```

This will:

* Generate logs continuously
* Validate data
* Store clean & rejected records
* Track ETL performance

---

## 3. Run Analytics

```text
1. sql/03_views.sql
2. sql/01_basic.sql
3. sql/02_kpi.sql
4. sql/04_advanced.sql
5. sql/05_dashboard.sql
```

Or run all:

```sql
source sql/06_run.sql;
```

⚠️ `SOURCE` works only in MySQL CLI
